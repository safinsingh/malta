## 🔎 How it works

- `helios` is `malta`'s client engine, it finds and scores vulnerabilities specified in a configuration file (see the example helios/conf.yaml).
- After capturing the secret keys generated by `helios gen-keys`, insert them into `{helios/ares}/src/crypto.rs` in order to encrypt/decrypt your configuration. After writing your configuration, you'll need to re-build the binaries with `cargo build --release`.
- Notice that in the configuration, you'll need to specify the URL of a Firebase Realtime Database URL. This is where all scoring data will be appended.
- Once built, you can run `helios encrypt` to encrypt your configuration. You can now safely delete your `config.yaml` and place the encrypted `conf.z` on both your server and client.
- Now, start `ares` and distribute the scoring engine. Typically, this is done via the distribution of an insecure virtual machine with vulnerabilities preloaded.
